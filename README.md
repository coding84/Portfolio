style.css indicated red message, 

had to open new file in css to link css with stylesheet, as my css.stylesheet was indicating nt connected, application is continualsy refused. even after oopening a new folder in css, css.style will still indicate no connection, reached to one to one and discovred that the name of css name file was wrong, there it wouldnt connect, learned to link the right stylesheet with css by right clicking and it will show what file availabe. 

coding the header was quite challenging, however, looked back into my notes and used mdn web docs,used <!--ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><a href="/about">About Me</a></li>


sturggled with unordered list bullets on the body left margin section,done some research after  unacountable atempts of trying removing them,got rid of left marginby using <1--ul style="list-style-type:none-->

wanted to use some of my pictures but run out of time, however managed to learn how to uploading picture to put in the right folder using using for your project other googlechrome wil not be able to find.
