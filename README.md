# Portfolio
This Portfolio is about my work that demonstrates my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.


style.css indicated red message, 

had to open new file in css to link css with stylesheet, as my css.stylesheet was indicating nt connected, application is continualsy refused. even after oopening a new folder in css, css.style will still indicate no connection, reached to one to one and discovred that the name of css name file was wrong, there it wouldnt connect, learned to link the right stylesheet with css by right clicking and it will show what file is availabe.

even though didnt succeed getting the css working wtih my style.css through open a new file within the css, I learned about opening a new folder and file for css. 

coding the header and nav was quite challenging, however, looked back into my notes and used mdn web docs,used <!--ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><a href="/about">About Me</a></li>


sturggled with unordered list bullets on the body left margin section,done some research after  unacountable atempts of trying removing them,got rid of the bulletpoints using <1--ul style="list-style-type:none-->

wanted to use some of my pictures but run out of time, however managed to learn the importance when uploadoding picture to put in the root folder otherwise imposible to find or read by chrome.

Also worked the background with backgroud linear-gradient. was not diffult as used the Mmdn web-linear gradient 

most of my work too afwul a lot of time as went back to all my classes to revise and practise, as I was ridiclously behind due to software fault set up. 

this time remmebered to update my git lab more often,git add, git commit and git push.
